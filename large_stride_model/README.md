There are 2 relevant files:
1. arch_stride.py : This defines the architecture.
2. run_emulator_stride.py : Contains python defs Fortran would call.

I guess 1 & 2 can be combined into one script. I am also attaching a test python script that I used for debugging (test_coupling.py) The two calls at the end of this file is what MiMA needs.
